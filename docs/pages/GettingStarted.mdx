<PageHeader title="Getting started">
  Hello! 😊 Fine is a small, opinionated CSS framework to make sites look
  alright with minimal effort.
</PageHeader>

## Features

- 🔥 Embraces semantic HTML to make native elements look great out of the box, without classes
- 😎 Small set of utilities for additional states and convenience
- 🐛 Tiny footprint with no runtime dependencies or build step required
- 🧼 Built on top of [sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css) for sane, robust defaults
- 🌈 Automatic color system that reduces time spent fiddling with color palettes
- 🪗 Fully responsive

## Usage

Fine is not currently on npm, but you can install it from this repository:

```

```

Then import it in your project:

```

or

@import "finecss/dist/index.min.css" layer(fine);

@layer fine {
  /* You can add customizations and override variables here. */
}
```

## Development

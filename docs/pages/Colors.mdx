  You can tweak Fine's look and feel to match your project through CSS
  variables.

## Color scheme

Fine comes with two color palettes â€” neutral and primary. All colors share the same hue (should be between 0 and 359), which is stored in the `--theme-tint` CSS variable. Changing this variable allows you to easily adjust the entire color scheme, and in most cases, this will be the only variable you need to touch.

By default, the primary color is based on the theme variables just like every other color. This will work for many colors. But sometimes you'll need more control, e.g. if you want a particularly vibrant primary color. When that happens, you can override the primary color by specifying hue, saturation, and lightness:

```
--theme-primary: 200 80% 50%;
```

### Playground

You can try the different color parameters below:

<Examples.ColorPalette />
<ThemePlayground />

## Other variables

There are more variables than can be customized. Have a look at the [variables file](https://github.com/andreasphil/fine/blob/main/src/base/variables.css) to learn more.

  Various utilities and small stuff that didn't really fit anywhere else.

## Content width

By default, Fine applies some padding to the `body`, constrains its maximum width, and centers it. You can use the following variables to manage (or disable) the behavior:

Add the `data-container` attribute to a block element in order to horizontally center it and apply a maximum width. Containers can be customized either globally or on a per-container basis:

- `--body-width`: Will be used as `max-width`
- `--body-padding-x`
- `--body-padding-y`

## Spinner

<Preview code={Examples.spinner} />

## Shadows

<Examples.BoxShadow />

## JavaScript

Fine comes with a small number of JavaScript utilities. These are optional, but can help you with some otherwise tedious tasks. You can import them from `fine`.

### Theme color management

Fine can take care of setting the current theme color for you based on your styles and the active color scheme. It uses the value of `--c-surface-bg` and automatically refreshes when the user switches between light and dark mode.

```js
import { useThemeColor, refreshThemeColor } from "finecss";

// Use unsubscribe() if you need to un-register the event listeners used by
// the function
const { unsubscribe } = useThemeColor();

// This will immediately refresh the theme color
refreshThemeColor();
```

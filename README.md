  Design System üê•
</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A small, opinionated CSS framework to make sites look good with minimal effort</strong>
</p>

- üî• Embraces semantic HTML to make native elements look great out of the box, without classes
- üòé Small set of utilities for additional states and convenience
- üêõ Tiny (<6kb min+gzip) footprint with no runtime dependencies or build step required
- üåà Automatic color system that reduces time spent fiddling with color palettes
- ü™ó Fully responsive

## Installation

From a CDN:

```css
@import url("https://esm.sh/gh/andreasphil/design-system@<tag>/dist/design-system.min.css")
layer(theme);
```

```js
import { useThemeColor } from "https://esm.sh/gh/andreasphil/design-system@<tag>";
```

With a package manager:

```sh
npm install github:andreasphil/design-system#<tag>
```

## Usage

Find the demo at <https://andreasphil.github.io/design-system/>.

First, import the CSS. I recommend using [layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) to avoid conflicts and specificity chaos when customizing.

```css
@import "@andreasphil/design-system/style.css" layer(theme);

@layer theme {
  /* You can add customizations and override variables here. */
}
```

The CSS loosely follows [CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/):

- **Global, high-level styles:** nost styling is global styling of plain HTML elements. There are a bunch of design tokens for colors, fonts, shared spacing, etc. in [`src/base/variables.css`](./src/base/variables.css) that you can use to customize the Design System or apply to your own components.

- **Blocks:** The framework includes opinionated styling for almost all common HTML elements inside [`src/blocks/`](./src/blocks/).

- **Exceptions:** Some blocks, such as buttons, come with variants (also called exceptions). [According to CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/exception.html#why-data-attributes), variants are applied using attributes.

- **Composition & utilites:** With the exception of a few utilities, these are outside the scope of the framework.

### Automatic theme color

There is a helper that will manage the theme color for light and dark mode automatically:

```js
import { useThemeColor } from "@andreasphil/design-system";

const { unsubscribe } = useThemeColor();

// Call if you want to stop automatic theme color management
unsubscribe();
```

## Development

Design System is built with [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev). Packages are managed by [npm](https://npmjs.org). The following commands are available:

```sh
node --run dev          # Compile stylesheets in watch mode
node --run build        # Bundle for production
```

For a demo, open [index.html](./index.html) in a browser.

## Deployment

Deployment should work out of the box on GitHub Pages.

## Credits

This library uses a number of open source packages listed in [package.json](./package.json). Icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). It was inspired by [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/).

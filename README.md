- 🔥 Embraces semantic HTML to make native elements look great out of the box, without classes
- 😎 Small set of utilities for additional states and convenience
- 🐛 Tiny (<6kb min+gzip) footprint with no runtime dependencies or build step required
- 🌈 Automatic color system that reduces time spent fiddling with color palettes
- 🪗 Fully responsive

## Installation

From a CDN:

```css
@import url("https://esm.sh/gh/andreasphil/design-system@<tag>/dist/index.min.css")
layer(theme);
```

```js
import { useThemeColor } from "https://esm.sh/gh/andreasphil/design-system@<tag>";
```

With a package manager:

```sh
npm install github:andreasphil/design-system#<tag>
```

## Usage

Find the demo at <https://design-system.a13i.dev>.

First, import the CSS. I recommend using [layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) to avoid conflicts and specificity chaos when customizing.

```css
@import "@andreasphil/design-system/style.css" layer(theme);

@layer theme {
  /* You can add customizations and override variables here. */
}
```

### Automatic theme color

There is a helper that will manage the theme color for light and dark mode automatically:

```js
import { useThemeColor } from "@andreasphil/design-system";

const { unsubscribe } = useThemeColor();

// Call if you want to stop automatic theme color management
unsubscribe();
```

## Development

Design System is built with [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev). Packages are managed by [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). The following commands are available:

```sh
pnpm dev          # Compile stylesheets in watch mode
pnpm build        # Bundle for production
```

For a demo, open [index.html](./index.html) in a browser.

## Deployment

Deployment should work out of the box when linking the repository to a project on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Credits

This library uses a number of open source packages listed in [package.json](./package.json). Icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). It was inspired by [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/).
